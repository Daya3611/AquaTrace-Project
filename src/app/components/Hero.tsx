    description: "Agriculture uses around 70% of the world's freshwater. Understanding the water footprint helps optimize water use, ensuring that water resources are used efficiently and conserved for future needs, especially in water-scarce regions.",
  },
  {
    title: "2. Sustainability",
    description: "Calculating water footprints promotes sustainable farming practices. By knowing how much water is used for specific crops, farmers can adopt more water-efficient methods, reduce waste, and lessen environmental impact.",
  },

  {
    title: "4. Economic Efficiency",
    description: "Efficient water use reduces costs for farmers by minimizing water waste, improving crop yields, and avoiding over-irrigation. This leads to better financial sustainability in the agricultural sector.",

    title: "Rainwater Harvesting",
    description: "Collecting and storing rainwater for irrigation helps farmers reduce their reliance on freshwater from other sources. This method is especially useful in areas with seasonal rains.",
  },
  {
    title: "Precision Agriculture",
    description: "Using technology like soil moisture sensors, drones, and satellite data helps farmers monitor water needs accurately and apply water only where and when itâ€™s needed. This reduces unnecessary water use.",
  },
  {
    title: "Soil and Crop Management",
    description: "Practices like mulching, cover cropping, and improving soil health increase water retention in the soil, reducing the need for irrigation. Healthy soils absorb more water and release it slowly to plants.",
